# Expense Tracker App

This is a simple **Expense Tracker application** built using **React** and **Redux Toolkit**.

I created this project to practice **authentication**, **state management**, and **CRUD operations** in a real-world style React application.
For this project,**I didn’t use a backend**
The goal was to demonstrate frontend skills like authentication flow, state management, filtering, and CRUD operations.
I have already built several mini projects, so integrating a backend (Node.js + MongoDB) is not an issue for me.

**NOTE** this project test purpose only. once you create the account with your data, incase browser reload all data is **"LOST"**
